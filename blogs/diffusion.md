# Diffusion Model 

Diffusion Model is a Generative model , that means It is capable of generating the data. It generates the the data through the process of adding the noise into data and then removing it. It takes the sample of pure noise and iteratively transform it into data like images or audio. It works in following 2 steps: 

## Forward Diffusion Process :
  Process that begin with clean data sample(like an image), and we gradually add the noise into data over multiple steps. This process transforms the data close to  pure Gausian Noise. This process is modeled as *Markov Chain* , where each step is small amount of noise.  

## Reverse Diffusion Process:
   The main task of Diffusion Model is to learn the reverese process that means denoising the data step by step. Typicallly. a neural network (often a U-Net) is trained to perform this denoising task. 

## Training Process

**Step1** : 
The Training process is repeated untill model the converges. 

**Step2**: 
A clean image is sampled from the dataset , this is the image before any noise is added. 

**Step3**:
A random timestamp t is selected from 1 to **T** where T is total number of diffusion steps. 

**Step4**: 
A noise sample is ùúñ is drawn from standard normal distribution. This noise will be added to the clean image. 

**Step5**: Gradient Descent
The model, represented by ùúñùúÉ , is trained to predict the noise ùúñ added to the clean image. The following components are involved:
Noisy Image: 
Loss Function:  Gradient Descent is used to minimize the difference between the predicted noise and true noise. Goal is to make them as close as possible. 
Target Noise: True noise will be target for the model's prediction. 

- Training process involves learning to predict the noise added to clean image. Then model is optimized by minimizing the difference between predicted noise and actual noise.
