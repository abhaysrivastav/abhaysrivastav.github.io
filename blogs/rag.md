# RAG Model 
RAG Model is hybrid model that has two components:
  1) Retrieval Model
  2) Generation Model
In practice, when RAG model is prompted to generate some text or answer of any question , it first retieves the relevent information from the knowledge base and provides the augmented. It then uses this context as a direct input to guide the generative process, due to this it also uses real world data and dont fully reply on training data.This dynamic approch allows RAG model to produce more accurate and updated information.
