# Basic Coding Patterns

## Two Pointers
  * Traverse or Manipulate the sequential data structure such as array or LinkedList.
  * If there is a requirement to find the 2 elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, two pointer pattern should be the first strategy.
  * When to use this approch:
    *   Linear Data Structure
    *   Process pairs
    *   Dynamic Pointer Movement


## Fast & Slow Pointers:
  * This Pattern uses 2 pointers to traverse an iterable data structure.
  * Spead of the 2 pointers can be adjusted based on the problem statement.
  * Is used to determine the specific pattern or structure in data.
  * When to use it:
    * Linear Data Structure
    * In Finding the cycle or intersection detection
    * In finding starting element at second quantile 

## Sliding Window
  * It is used to process the sequential data, like array and strings for example for example to solve subarray or substring problem.
  * It involves maintaining a dynamic window that slide through the array or string, and it adjust its boundaries as needed to track relevent element or characters.
  * Window is used to slide over the data in chunks corresponding to window size.
