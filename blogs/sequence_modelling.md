# RNN

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed for processing sequential data. It features loops that allow information to be retained across time steps, making it effective at capturing temporal patterns. This capability makes RNNs particularly useful for applications such as time series forecasting, speech recognition, and natural language processing. More advanced variants, like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, have been developed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, such as difficulty in learning long-term dependencies.

- Regular neuron which has only one weight Wx to represent its contribution, a recurrent neuron has two weights Wx and Wy to represent the contribution of the input and previous output respectively.
